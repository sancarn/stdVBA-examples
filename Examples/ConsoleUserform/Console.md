# `Console.frm`

## Introduction

### What is the VBA Console?
The main idea behind the console is to let the user decide which procedures to run and to work with basic script at runtime.


### Preparation
To Prepare the console you have to do the following:  
If you want to activate Intellisense then go to the variable `Intellisense_Active` and set it to `true`.  
To further Improve Intellisense enable `Microsoft Visual Studio Extensebility 5.3` as reference.    
If you want to activate stdLambda function go to the variable `stdLambda_Active` and set it to `true`. It is dependant sancarns stdVBA class `stdLambda`  
https://github.com/sancarn/stdVBA/tree/master  

Run `Console.Show`  
    This will initialize the console  

Now the Console can be used in process  

### How to use is
The Console sees the current Line as the code that needs to be run.  
To write several line see below.  
To pass arguments you have to write it like in vba: FunctionName(Arg1, Arg2, ArgN)
The Console interprets the line as a Leftside and a Rightside. Leftside is the destination-Location, like a variable or the Console itself. The Rightside is the Code that will be interpreted.  


1. Password Protection
The Console is Password protected:  
If no Password is assigned then it is ""
Changing it only works from outside the Console through its Public Function

2. Run Macros with and without arguments:  
```vb
    HelloWorld
    HelloWorld()
    PrintToDebug("TextAsString")
    Add(Arg1, Arg2)
```

3. Create and run variables:  
```vb
    Dim x As Long       'Will remove this Function at the End of its Scope. More on that furher down
    Private x As Long   'Can only be used by the Console
    Public x As Long    'This can be returned outside of the Console
    x = 3               ' Assumes Variant
    x = "3"             ' Assumes Variant, but only gets the 3
    x = ?1+2            ' Creates Lambda, that when run returns 1+2
    x = ?$1+$2          ' Creates Lambda, that adds two arguments together. More on Lambdas see: https://github.com/sancarn/stdVBA/tree/master
    x = y               ' Assigns Value of another Variable
    x = Add(Arg1, Arg2) ' Assigns Value of Procedure/Lambda
    x = y==z            ' Compare 2 Values
    x = y+z             ' Adds two Values and returns it to x
    x = y++2            ' Increments y by 2 and returns its value to x
```

4. Loops and Conditions
```vb
    ' First arguments will run once, second is the Break-Condition, third will be run at the end of each cycle. All following arguments will be run for each cycle
    for(Dim x as Long, x==30, x++1, HelloWorld)
    ' First argument is the breakcondition for both until and while loops. All following Arguments will be repeated every cycle
    until(x==3, HelloWorld, x++1)
    while(x<>3, HelloWorld, x++1)
    ' if and select statements need their case-sensitive keywords
    if(x==y Then x++1, x Else y--1, y)
    select(x Case ==0, x++1, Case >=2, x--1, Case <>2, x Case Else, x**2)
```
5. Multiline
Those long statements will get pretty wild pretty soon. For that there is the `Multiline` and `EndMultiline` statements.  
As long as `Endmultiline` is not written every enter will insert a new line without executing it.  
Once `Endmultiline` is written and executed all previous lines up to `Multiline` will be combined into 1 Line and executed.  
6. Script
Scripts are written with `Script` and `EndScript`.  
Same as `Multiline`, but here the Lines will not get saved as one, but every line is a command for the Console.  
To still write several lines, that get compressed to one you have to write the `_` Character last and then press Enter.  
```vb
ScriptName(Arg1 As Long, Arg2 As Long)           ' Needs to be first line
Dim x As Long                                    ' Exists till the End of the Script
Dim Lam As stdLambda
Lam = ?$1*$2
Until(x==30, _
Lam(Arg1+x, Arg2+x)_
x++1)
If(Arg1==1 Then _
x = 2 _
Else _
x = 3)
EndScript
```
As of now, Intendation is not supported
7. Dim
Dim Variables will run out of Scope and be deleted. That means:  
When Pressing Enter: It will be deleted immediatly  
When in a Loop     : Once the Loop is finished
When in a Condition: Once the Condition is finished
When in a Script   : Once the Script is finished

8. Special Keyword
Help      : Prints the Help Text
Clear     : Deletes Text 
Multiline : See Point 5
Info      : Prints the Last Error
Exit      : Hides the Console and Clears the Text (Will currently kill Excel)
Script    : See Point 6

9. Public Methods
```vb
    ' Passes Command to HandleCode and executes it
    Public Function Execute(Command As String) As Variant

    ' Gets UserInput of specific Type. In Normal Case it takes Variant
    Public Function GetUserInput(Message As Variant, Optional InputType As Long = 12) As Variant

    ' Gets UserInput, but only allows the PreDeclared Answers of AllowedValues, Answers will run if defined.
    ' Answers, when defined need to be of same size as AllowedValues
    Public Function CheckPredeclaredAnswer(Message As Variant, AllowedValues As Variant, Optional Answers As Variant = Empty) As Variant

    ' Adds vbCrLf to Text and Calls PrintConsole
    Public Sub PrintEnter(Text As Variant, Optional Colors As Variant, Optional ColorLength As Variant)

    ' Prints Text to Control
    ' Color may be 1 Value or an Array of Values
    ' ColorLength is an Array of Long, that will color ColorLength(i) of Characters in Color(i) 
    Public Sub PrintConsole(Text As Variant, Optional Colors As Variant, Optional ColorLength As Variant)

    ' Will add a Script to ConsVarIndex
    Public Sub AddScript(Name As String, Arguments As String, Script As String)

    ' Will set a new Password if you know the old one
    Public Function Password(Old_Password As String, New_PassWord As String) As Boolean

    ' Returns the Value of a Public Variable from the Console
    ' If that Variable is NOT Public it will return Nothing
    Public Function GetPublicVariable(Name As String) As Variant
```
