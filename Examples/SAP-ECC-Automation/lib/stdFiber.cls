'@module
'`stdFiber` allows production of partitioned asynchronous procedures which can be run within a fiber runtime.
'`stdFiber.Create()` is used to create our fiber procedures
'`stdFiber.runFibers()` is used to run our fiber procedures within a fiber runtime.
'Fibers can be useful especially when dealing with asynchronous functions
'@example **1. Simple fiber example**:
'```vb
'Sub main()
'    Dim fibers as new Collection
'    For i = 1 to 100
'        fibers.add createFiber("http://example.com/" & i)
'    next
'    
'    'Run requests concurrently across 10 fibers
'    set results = stdFiber.runFibers(fibers, numFibers:=10)
'End Sub
'Function createFiber(ByVal url as string) as stdFiber
'    Dim fib as stdFiber: set fib = stdFiber.Create()
'    set fib.meta("status") = getStatusUpdater()
'    fib.add stdCallback.CreateFromMethods("", "step1_GetRequest").bind(url)
'    fib.add stdCallback.CreateFromMethods("", "step2_AwaitStatus")
'    fib.add stdCallback.CreateFromMethods("", "step3_ReturnData")
'    fib.addErrorHandler stdCallback.CreateFromMethods("", "stepX_OnError")
'    set createFiber = fib
'End Function
'Public Function step1_GetRequest(ByVal url as string, ByVal fib as stdFiber) as boolean
'    fib.meta("status").value = "step1"
'    'Store information in bespoke fiber procedure metadata
'    set fib.meta("req") = stdHTTP.Create(url, HTTPAsync)
'    step1_GetRequest = true
'End Function
'Public Function step2_AwaitStatus(ByVal fib as stdFiber) as boolean
'    fib.meta("status").value = "step2"
'    step1_GetRequest = fib.meta("req").status <> 0
'End Function
'Public Function step3_ReturnData(ByVal fib as stdFiber) as boolean
'    Call fib.resolve(fib.meta("req").ResponseText)
'    fib.meta("status").value = "Complete"
'End Function
'Public Sub stepX_OnError(ByVal fib as stdFiber)
'    fib.meta("status").value = fib.ErrorText
'End Sub

'```
'@example **2. Use of agents**:
'```vb
'Sub main()
'  Dim fibers as new Collection
'  For i = 1 to 100
'    fibers.add createFiber("http://example.com/" & i)
'  next
'  set results = stdFiber.runFibers(fibers, numFibers:=10)
'End Sub
'Function createFiber(ByVal url as string) as stdFiber
'  Dim fib as stdFiber: set fib = stdFiber.Create()
'  fib.add stdCallback.CreateFromPointer(AddressOf step1_CreateAgent, vbBoolean, Array(vbObject))
'  fib.add stdCallback.CreateFromPointer(AddressOf step2_Navigate, vbBoolean, Array(vbObject, vbString)).bind(url)
'  fib.add stdCallback.CreateFromPointer(AddressOf step3_Await, vbBoolean, Array(vbObject))
'  set createFiber = fib
'End Function
'Function step1_CreateAgent(ByVal fib as stdFiber) as boolean
'  'An agent is unique to the fiber runtime and can be used across different fiber procedures.
'  set fib.agent("ie") = CreateObject("InternetExplorer.Application")
'  fib.agent("ie").visible = true
'  step1_CreateAgent = true
'End Function
'Function step2_Navigate(ByVal url as string, ByVal fib as stdFiber) as Boolean
'  fib.agent("ie").Navigate(url)
'End Function
'Function step3_Await(ByVal fib as stdFiber) as Boolean
'  step3_Await = fib.agent("ie").readystate = 4
